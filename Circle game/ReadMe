This is just a fun game i in which i practiced my skills with adding animations and sounds. I used paper.js library for animations and howler.js library for sounds. 
This game basically that an cool shrinking circle with changing random color with animation appers on the screen and also producing a funcky sound parallely when an alphabet key is pressed.
